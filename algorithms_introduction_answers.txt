1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

- Making coffee;

A: 

GET coffee, filter, water
SET filter equal to 1
SET water equal to 3
IF coffee is less than 3 AND filter is equal to 1 THEN
	SET coffee to water
	Make coffee
ELSE IF coffee is greater than 3 AND filter is equal to 1 THEN
	SET coffee to water
	Make coffee
END IF

- Washing dishes;

A: 

Get dirtyDishes
	WHILE dirtyDishes is not equal to clean THEN
		Set dirtyDishes equal to clean

- A choice of your own.

A: 

Take the dog out

Get dog
IF dog has to go to bathroom
	Take dog out
END IF

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

A: 

1. Tinder, uses social scores.
2. Facebook, matches advertisers with filtered data.
3. Uber, connects users with nearby drivers.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

A: Efficient algorithms are based on run-time and data size.
