Exercises

1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.

A: Clean code is self-documenting code. 

2. Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was not created to an acceptable standard.

A: If a microwave's computer was written wrong it could start a fire. 

3. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

A:

FUNCTION tempreatureConvert(temperature, degreeType)               
 IF degreeType = "Fahrenheit" THEN               
 	SET newTemperature to (temperatureâˆ’32) * (5/9)       
 	PRINT newTemperature                
 ELSE IF degreeType = "Celcius" 
 	SET newTemperature to temperature * 1.8000 + 32.00   
 	PRINT newTemperature
 END IF
END FUNCTION

4. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.

A: Yes, it's self-documenting.

5. Using pseudocode, refactor the code for the following examples using the principles you have learned in this checkpoint.

a. The following function prints the subtotal of a customer's transaction and receives payment accordingly.

A: 

FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate, paymentType)
   total = subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
   PRINT "Your total due is: " + total

   IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Change due: " + amount - total
   ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
       CALL getPayment RETURNING amount
       PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + total
   END IF
END FUNCTION

b. The following function checks out a book if there are no issues with the guest's account.

A: 

FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
 IF guest.accountActive AND IF NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) AND IF guest.outstandingFees = 0 THEN
    APPEND book to guest.books
    SET book.status to "Checked Out"
    PRINT "Your books have been issued."
 ELSE
     PRINT "Unable to check out book."
 END IF
END FUNCTION

c. The following class is a code snippet that should support the transactions a customer can perform at an ATM.

A: 

CLASS BankAccount

 FUNCTION displayBalance
    PRINT balance
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION deposit(amount)
    SET balance to balance + amount
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION withdraw(amount)
     IF balance > amount THEN
       SET balance to balance - amount
     END
 END FUNCTION

END Class

CLASS BankOffers

 FUNCTION creditCardOffer
     IF NOT(customer.hasCreditCard) THEN
         CALL offerCreditCard
     END
 END FUNCTION

 FUNCTION checkStatus
     IF NOT(customer.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
         CALL offerCheckingAccount
     END
 END FUNCTION

END Class

Programming Questions

6. Square Given an array of integers, find out whether the sum of the integers is a perfect square. If it is a perfect square, return the square root, otherwise return the sum.

function squareFinder(array) {
	sum = 0;
	for (i=0; i < array.length; i++) {
		sum += array[i];
	}
	if (Math.sqrt(sum) % 1 === 0) {return Math.sqrt(sum);}
	else {return sum;}
}


7. Duplicate Given an array of integers, find out whether the array contains any duplicate elements. The function should return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and false if every element is distinct.

function findDuplicates(array) {
	for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
		for (var j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
			if (i !== j) {
				if (array[i] === array[j]) {
					return true;
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return false;
}
