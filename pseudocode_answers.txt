1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to map out algorithms.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing, or it will break.

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater than second number THEN
	PRINT "first number"
ELSE
	PRINT "second number"
END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

INIT base to 0
WHILE base is less than 100
	ADD 1 to base
	PRINT "base"
END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION findAddress
INPUT address-to-find
INPUT addressBook
FOR addressBook
	IF address-book-address equals address-to-find
	RETURN entire listing
	END IF
END FOR
PRINT "Not Found"
END FUNCTION

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

findAddress(address, addressBook) {
	for (i=0; i < addressBook.length; i++)
		if (addressBook[i] === address) {return addressBook;}
}
	return "Not Found"
